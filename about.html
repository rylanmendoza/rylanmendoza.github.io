        <p>Prior to taking this class, I had taken another programming class back in high school and another one last
            semester. However, I admit that despite taking those classes, my knowledge of programming is still fairly
            limited with concepts still being very confusing to me. The only programming language I have experience with
            is Python as that was what those two classes used.

            By taking this class, I am hoping to further improve my knowledge of programming as a whole and to develop a
            higher understanding of how to make programs so that I may have that knowledge for possibly applying for a
            job.

            Aside from programming, I mainly have an interest in cars and mechanical work as I hope to understand more
            about cars and how they function. I also enjoy photography on the side as well as I find it to be rather fun
            to do.

            I hope to have fun taking this class!</p>
