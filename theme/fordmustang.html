    <p>The Ford Mustang is an American car manufactured by Ford. It was originally based on the platform of the second
        generation North American Ford Falcon, a compact car.[2] The original 1962 Ford Mustang I two-seater concept car had
        evolved into the 1963 Mustang II four-seater concept car which Ford used to pretest how the public would take
        interest in the first production Mustang. The 1963 Mustang II concept car was designed with a variation of the
        production model's front and rear ends with a roof that was 2.7 inches shorter.[3] Introduced early on April 17,
        1964[4] (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), and thus dubbed as a "1964Â½" by Mustang fans, the 1965 Mustang was
        the automaker's most successful launch since the Model A.[5] The Mustang has undergone several transformations to
        its current sixth generation.

    <p>The Mustang is one of the main cars that spawned the "Pony car" car class in early America. The mustang itself is easily
        one of the most iconic American cars as it was one of the original muscle cars. As stated above, the car is one of Americas
        most successful cars as recent recordings say that in total, over 10 million mustangs have been produced as of Augest 2018.

    <p>The newest iteration of the Mustang is met with a lot of praise as it still holds true to its early predecessors. There is no
        doubt that the Mustang is one of the most popular cars within the U.S and even some global fans too. The mustang has been set
        to be exported to other countries. The newest mustangs have been seen to be exported in other countries such as Europe and Japan
        with mixed receptions. Business for American cars in other nations isn't necessarily as successful as it is in the U.S.

    <p>Personally, I see the mustang as a really cool muscle car. I always did admire the idea of the pony car that was developed
        in the early 1980s and the Mustang is a prime example of one of the best muscle cars produced in the U.S. 
    </p>

    <p>My personal favorie mustang is the Boss 302 that was made in the early 80s. The muscle cars of that time in general are in my
        opinion the "golden years" more muscle cars as they were all sleek and powerful cars. Don't get me wrong, modern muscle cars are still
        nice cars, but I would prefer the older American cars anyday.
