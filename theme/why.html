    <p>In short, these series of websites were created as a means of expressing my creativity. As a new student in the world of
        programming, doing something like this is an entirely new experience for me as programming is certainly something I want to know
        more about.
    </p>

    <p>That being said, for an assignment that needed to be done for the class, I decided to combine my passion for cars with this 
        assignment to show what I am capable of doing so far in my Programming class. 
    </p>

    <p>In all honesty, not all of the information presented in these web-pages will be 100% accurate as I combined what I knew
        about the history of cars with my personal experiences and opinions about each one. These series of web-pages may seem like
        amatuer work (in which isn't entirely wrong) but I'm still learning and I believe that's all that counts.
