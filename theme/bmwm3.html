    <p>The BMW M3 is a high-performance version of the BMW 3 Series, developed by BMW's in-house motorsport division, BMW M
        GmbH. M3 models have been produced for every generation of 3 Series since the E30 M3 was introduced in 1986.
    
        The initial model was available in a coupé body style, with a convertible body style added soon after. M3 sedans
        were available during the E36 (1994-1999) and E90 (2008-2012) generations. Since 2015 the M3 has been solely
        produced in the sedan body style, due to the coupé and convertible models being rebranded as the 4 Series range,
        making the high-performance variant the M4.
    
        Upgrades over the regular 3 Series models include engines, handling, brakes, aerodynamics, lightweight materials and
        various interior upgrades.</p>

    <p>The BMW M3 is in my opinion, one of the greatest German car lines to ever be produced, with it proving its greatness through
        many official races against other racing companies that had established a reputation for being the best.</p>
    

    <p>As stated above, the coupe and convertible models of the BMW has been rebranded as the M4, leaving the newer M3's to become BMW's newest
        line of sedans. While it still holds the same power and pressence, it is a rather strange change that BMW had made to their 
        trademark line of coupes.</p>

    <p>While the M4 is a great modern replacement for the M3, the M3 itself despite being a sedan now still is a powerful and capable car.
        The main difference now is that it can hold more people in it now. </p>

    <p>Despite BMW's new coupe being branded as the M4, it is still
        an M3 at heart, just with a different name. </p>

    <p>The reason I like this car so much is because of the history I've had with the car. I was first introduced to this car as a kid
        upon playing the old Gran Turismo games. This car happened to be one of the playable cars and my interest in it spiked immediately
        as it was one of the faster cars in the game and was (in my opinion) one of the greatest looking cars. My interest in the car
        increased drastically after playing the 2005 Need For Speed Most Wanted game where the racing version, the BMW GTR was the cover car
        of the game and the fastest car there. I still remember playing that game as a kid with my friends and always having a great time. </p>

    <p>Ever since then, my view on the BMW M3 hasn't changed much as I still like the German Machine. If I were to own one, I'd personally
        go for the older 1990s E30 models as those particular models were the ones I grew up liking and also because of their retro 
        appearence as I like early 90s cars the most.
