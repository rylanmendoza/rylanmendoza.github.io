    <p>The Dodge Challenger is the name of three different generations of automobiles (two of those being pony cars)
        produced by American automobile manufacturer Dodge. However, the first use of the Challenger name by Dodge was in
        1959 for marketing a "value version" of the full-sized Coronet Silver Challenger. </p>
    
    <p>From model years 1970 to 1974, the first generation Dodge Challenger pony car was built using the Chrysler E
        platform in hardtop and convertible body styles sharing major components with the Plymouth Barracuda.
    
        The second generation, from model years 1978 to 1983, was a badge engineered Mitsubishi Galant Lambda, a coupe
        version of an economical compact car.
    
        The third and current generation is a pony car that was introduced in early 2008 originally as a rival to the
        evolved fifth generation Ford Mustang and the fifth generation Chevrolet Camaro. </p>

    <p>This iteration of the Challenger is in my opinion one of the most sleek good looking pony cars that came out of mid 1900s.
        There are a lot of great looking and stylish cars that came out of that generation, but I feel like the Challenger is one of 
        the best that came out of that time. 
    </p>

    <p>In my opinion, the Dodge Challenger is a very nice and sleek car. Owning one would be a dream come true. However, that would sadly
        just be a dream as these particular cars are very rare to come by. The best bet at getting one would be to buy a pristine restored
        version of the car (which is absolutely not cheap) or to find a junked one and restore it (which isn't any easier). Those who still
        own these cars are very lucky people.

    <p>Newer versions of the car are both bulky and very powerful cars as the engines under the hood produce massive amounts of powerful
        like any other muscle car. However, there's something about the Challenger that is very appealing to me like the Mustang and
        the Corvette.
    </p>

    <p>The Dodge Challenger in my opinion is my second favorite American car right next to the Mustang and the Camaro.
        The car is most commonly described as bulky and huge like any muscle car, but it is powerful and in my opinion, 
        is one of the many appeals that make me like muscle cars in general.
    </p>

    <p>To me, the Dodge Challenger is a great looking car, and in the hands of a capable driver, can actually be a really good
        car for racing. Of course, that's just me. I have no experience behind the wheel of a muscle car, but I feel like driving 
        such a powerful car like the Challenger would be a very fun experience.
